## Welcome 
This app is designed to encourage users to surf more frequently.
There is a point system to encourage users to get points and track their progress

### Why I developed this app

I found myself not surfing as often as I want to and I often leave it to tomorrow, which never gets anything done. 
This app will help to provide accountability

Welcome message 


### Error handling
- invalid_input prints a statement if the input is invalid 

## R2 - separate headings for each documentation requirement and answers organised under the appropriate headings


## R3 - Full attribution to referenced sources (where applicable)
## R4 - link to source control repository

## R5 - Develop a stateent of purpose and scope for your application. It must include 

- Describe at a high level what the application will do

- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it 

- identify the target audiencec 
Surfers but could pivot the product to a fitness tracker by changing some of the features

- explain how a member of the target audience will use it
They will run the application, run gem bundler which will give them access to the required gems. From github they can copy the repo which will give them the required files to run the program. They will then be able to add in information about their surf sessions which will give them a score rating. They can also favorite a surf session and they can export data on their surf sessions. 

## R6 - Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include
- at least 3 features
The features I have added in this application include 
- Adding a surfing session 
- Point scoring system

- describe each features
Adding surf session - This allows the user to input detailed information about a surf session. This can help them track their progress over time and could potentially help them identify good surfing conditions for a particular location which will ideally lead them to surfing more frequently.

Point scoring system - This will identify a score based on 3 factors, the length in minutes of how long a user has surfed for. The difficulty of surf conditions will reward users based on more difficult condition, it can be assumed that users will have less minutes in the surf if the conditions are more difficult which is why they are rewarded with a points multiplier for more difficult conditions. The third factor influencing the score is the day of week, if it's the weekend, the user will score less than if it's a weekday, this is because it's likely to be more difficult to surf on a weekday before/after work than it is on the weekend.

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling


## R7 - Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user


## R8 - Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.

## R9 - Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.


## R10 - Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
