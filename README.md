## Welcome 
This app is designed to encourage users to surf more frequently.
There is a point system to encourage users to get points and track their progress

### Why I developed this app

I found myself not surfing as often as I want to and I often leave it to tomorrow, which never gets anything done. 
This app will help to provide accountability 



##### 
```ruby 
Welcome message 


### Error handling
- invalid_input prints a statement if the input is invalid
